               We use a daily rate to calculate the interest on the balance on your account each day. The daily rate is the applicable APR times 1/365. Interest will be imposed in amounts or at rates not in excess of those permitted by applicable law.                 <br>

            The following rates apply to purchases and cash advances. If approved, the Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account will be provided in a table at the beginning of your Agreement. Your APRs will also be shown on your billing statement.<br>
            <br>
                
                <p><strong>For Account Type 1:</strong><br>
                The APR for purchases is the prime rate plus 11.74%. As of October 1, 2021, the daily rate for purchases was .04107% (APR 14.99%).</p>
                The APR for cash advances is the prime rate plus 23.74%. As of October 1, 2021, the daily rate for cash advances was .07395% (APR 26.99%).
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>For Account Type 2:</strong><br>
                The APR for purchases is the prime rate plus 20.74%. As of October 1, 2021, the daily rate for purchases was .06573% (APR 23.99%).</p>
                The APR for cash advances is the prime rate plus 23.74%. As of October 1, 2021, the daily rate for cash advances was .07395% (APR 26.99%).
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>For Account Type 3:</strong><br>
                The APR for purchases is the prime rate plus 23.74%. As of October 1, 2021, the daily rate for purchases was .07395% (APR 26.99%).</p>
                <p>The APR for cash advances is the prime rate plus 23.74%. As of October 1, 2021, the daily rate for cash advances was .07395% (APR 26.99%).</p>
                
                   
               <strong>Daily Rates May Vary.</strong> The APRs and the daily rates on your account vary with the market based on the prime rate. The prime rate for a billing cycle is the highest bank prime loan rate published in  <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> in its Money Rates section on the last business day of the calendar month preceding the first day of the billing cycle.<br><br>
                If the prime rate increases, the daily rates and APRs will increase. As a result, interest, your total minimum payment and the number of payments it would take you to pay off your account balance may increase. We apply any change in rates because of a prime rate change to your entire account balance. A change in the prime rate will take effect on the first day of the first billing cycle after the change. We may select a new interest rate index if the prime rate is not available.

                 <p>We figure the interest charge on your account separately for each balance type. We do this by applying the daily rate to
                the daily balance for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance is calculated for the following balance types,
                   as applicable: purchases, cash advances and balances subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions.
                 See below for how this works.</p>
                   <ol>
                       <li><strong>How to get the daily balance:</strong>We take the starting balance each day, add any new charges and fees, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance.<br>
                   <br>
                       <p>We apply fees to balance types as follows:</p>
                       <p>(a) late payment fees or returned payment fees are treated as new purchases; </p>
                       <p>(b) debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance;</p>
                       <p>(c) cash advance fees are added to the cash advance balance; and</p>
                     <p>(d) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance.</p></li>


                       <li><strong>How to get the daily interest amount:</strong> We multiply each daily balance by the daily rate that applies.</li>
                       <li><strong>How to get the starting balance for the next day:</strong> We add the daily interest amount in step 2 to the daily balance from step 1.</li>
                       <li><strong>How to get the interest charge for the billing cycle:</strong> We add all the daily interest amounts that were charged during the billing cycle.</li>
                   </ol>
                    We charge a minimum of $2.00 of  interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. This charge is added proportionately to each balance type.

Mastercard’s currency conversion procedure is based on rates observed in the wholesale market or government-mandated rates, where applicable. The currency conversion rate that Mastercard uses for a particular transaction is the rate for the applicable currency on the date that the transaction occurred. However, in limited situations, particularly where transaction submissions to Mastercard for processing are delayed, the currency conversion rate that Mastercard uses may be the rate for the applicable currency on the date that the transaction is processed. </p></td>

        <h2><strong>RESOLVING A DISPUTE WITH&nbsp;ARBITRATION</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT REJECT IT, THIS SECTION WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED.</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>CLAIMS AND PARTIES.</strong> If either you or we make a demand for arbitration, you and we must arbitrate any dispute or claim between you (including any
              other user of your account), and us (including our parents, affiliates, agents, employees, officers, and assignees) that directly or indirectly arises from or
              relates to your account, your account Agreement or our relationship, except as noted below. In addition, PayPal, Inc. and/or any assignee, agent, or service
              provider of ours that collects amounts due on your account are intended beneficiaries of this Arbitration section and may enforce it in full (notwithstanding
            any state law to the contrary).</li>
            <li>This Arbitration section broadly covers claims based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud and other intentional torts, negligence, constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity and claims for money damages and injunctive or declaratory relief, even if they arose before this section took effect. You may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.</li>
            <li>Examples of claims subject to arbitration are disputes about an account transaction, fees, charges or interest, the events leading up to the Agreement (such as any disclosures, advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements, warranties or representations made by us), an application for or denial of credit, any product or service provided by us or third parties in connection with the Agreement, credit reporting, benefit programs related to your account including any reward program, the collection of amounts due by our assignees, service providers, or agents and the manner of collection.</li>
            <li>However, we will not require you to arbitrate any individual case in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court. Also, even if all parties have opted to litigate a claim in court, you or we may elect arbitration with respect to any claim made by a new party or any claim later asserted by a party in any related or unrelated lawsuit, including modifying an individual claim to assert a class, representative or multi-party claim. Arbitration may be requested at any time, even where there is a pending lawsuit, unless a trial has begun, or a final judgment entered.</li>
            <li>Only a court will decide disputes about the validity, enforceability, coverage or scope of this Arbitration section or any part thereof. However, any dispute that concerns the validity or enforceability of the Agreement as a whole is for the arbitrator to decide.</li>
            <li><strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS.</strong> IF EITHER YOU OR WE ELECT TO ARBITRATE A CLAIM, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT (A) TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, EITHER AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER, OR (B) TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS WITH CLAIMS OF ANY OTHER PERSONS EXCEPT ACCOUNTHOLDERS ON YOUR ACCOUNT. THUS, YOU MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY ACCOUNTHOLDER WHO IS NOT AN ACCOUNTHOLDER ON YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU AGREE THAT ONLY ACCOUNTHOLDERS ON YOUR ACCOUNT MAY BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE.</li>
            <li><strong>PROCEDURES.</strong> The party who wants to arbitrate must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit or in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to Synchrony Bank, Legal Operation, P.O. Box 29110, Shawnee Mission, KS 66201-5320, ATTN: ARBITRATION DEMAND. The party seeking arbitration must select either the American Arbitration Association (AAA), 120 Broadway, Floor 21, New York, NY 10271, <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>, or JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018, <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>, to administer the arbitration. If neither administrator can handle the dispute, a court with jurisdiction will appoint an arbitrator.</li>
            <li>The arbitration administrator will appoint the arbitrator and will tell the parties what to do next. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of legal experience. The arbitrator must apply the same law, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), that would apply to an individual action in court, but may use different procedural rules. The arbitrator will apply the same statutes of limitation and privileges that a court would apply if the matter were pending in court.</li>
            <li>The arbitrator may award any damages or other relief or remedies that would apply under applicable law to an individual action brought in court, including, without limitation, punitive damages (governed by the Constitutional standards employed by the courts) and injunctive, equitable and declaratory relief (but only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim). The parties will bear the fees and costs of their attorneys, witnesses and experts. However, the arbitrator will have the authority to award fees and costs of attorneys, witnesses and experts to the extent permitted by the Agreement, the administrator’s rules or applicable law.</li>
            <li>The arbitration will take place by phone or at a location reasonably convenient to you. If you ask, we will pay all the fees the administrator or arbitrator charges if you cannot obtain a waiver of fees from the administrator and are acting in good faith. We will always pay arbitration costs required by the administrator’s rules or that are necessary for this Arbitration section to be enforced.</li>
            <li><strong>GOVERNING LAW.</strong> This Arbitration section is governed by the FAA. Utah law shall apply to the extent state law is relevant under the FAA, unless otherwise stated herein. The arbitrator’s award will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award. The arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award.</li>
            <li><strong>SURVIVAL.</strong> This Arbitration section shall survive the repayment of all amounts owed, the termination, cancellation or suspension of the Agreement or your account or credit privileges, any legal proceeding, and any bankruptcy by you, to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. If this Arbitration section conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules or the other provisions of the Agreement, this Arbitration section shall govern.</li>
            <li><strong>SEVERABILITY.</strong> If any portion of this Arbitration section is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions shall nevertheless remain in force with the following two exceptions. First, if a determination is made that the “No Class Actions” provision is unenforceable, and that determination is not reversed on appeal, then this Arbitration section shall be void in its entirety. Second, if a court determines that a public injunctive relief claim may proceed notwithstanding the “No Class Actions” provision, and that determination is not reversed on appeal, then the public injunctive relief claim will be decided by a court, and any individual claims will be arbitrated. The parties will ask the court to stay the public injunctive relief claim until the other claims have been finally concluded.</li>
            <li><strong>HOW TO REJECT ARBITRATION.</strong> You may reject this Arbitration section. If you do that, a court will resolve any dispute or claim. To reject this section, send us a notice within 45 days after you open your account or we first provided you with your right to reject this section. The notice must include your name, address, account number, and personal signature, and must be mailed to Synchrony Bank, P.O. Box 965012, Orlando, FL 32896-5012. This is the only way you can reject this section. Rejecting this Arbitration section will not affect any other provision of the Agreement. It will also not affect any prior arbitration agreement or dispute resolution provision between you and us, which will remain in full force and effect. If you don't reject this Arbitration section, it will be effective as of the date of the Agreement and will supersede any prior arbitration agreement between you and us that would otherwise be applicable.</li>

        <p class="ppcTerms-indent">This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.</p>

        <p><i>What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement</i></p>
        <p class="ppcTerms-indent">If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:</p>
        <p>Synchrony Bank<br>
          P.O. Box 965003,<br>
          Orlando, FL 32896-5003</p>
        <p>In your letter, give us the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Account information</i>: Your name and account number.</li>
            <li><i>Dollar amount</i>: The dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
            <li><i>Description of problem</i>: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You must contact us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.</li>
            <li>At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must notify us of any potential errors <i>in writing.</i> You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.</p>

        <p><i>What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter</i></p>
        <p>When we receive your letter, we must do two things:</p>
        <ol class="ppcTerms-indent">
            <li>Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.</li>
            <li>Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:</p>
        <ul class="ppcTerms-indent">
            <li>We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.</li>
            <li>The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.</li>
            <li>While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.</li>
            <li>We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:</p>
        <ul class="ppcTerms-indent">
            <li><i>If we made a mistake:</i> You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.</li>
            <li><i>If we do not believe there was a mistake:</i> You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within <i>10 days</i> telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.<br><br>If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.</p>

        <p><i>Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit&nbsp;Card&nbsp;Purchases</i></p>
        <p>If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.<br><br>To use this right, all of the following must be true:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)</li>
            <li>You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.</li>
            <li>You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at:</p>
        <p>Synchrony Bank<br>
          P.O. Box 965003,<br>
          Orlando, FL 32896-5003<br>
        </p>

        <p>While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.</p>

        <dd>Cash Rewards earned will be available for you to transfer to your PayPal account within approximately three days after each Eligible Purchase is made, provided your Card Account and PayPal account are open and in good standing and linked to each other.</dd>
        <dt>How to Use Cash Rewards</dt>
        <dd>Cash Rewards can be used once they are transferred by you to your PayPal account. If you have a PayPal Balance account, the Rewards can be used to make payments, make purchases, send money to other PayPal users, or transferred to your bank account or debit card linked to your PayPal account.&nbsp;If you do not have a PayPal Balance account, the Rewards can only be transferred to your bank account or debit card linked to&nbsp;your PayPal account.</dd>

    </div>
           <p>As a PayPal Cashback Mastercard (“Card”) Account (“Card Account”) Accountholder, you will earn cash back rewards (referred to as “Cash Rewards” or “Cash Back”) on Eligible Purchases made by you (subject to your available credit), the person to whom the Card Account was issued (“Accountholder” or “you”) or the authorized users on your Card Account, as set forth below. The amount of Cash Rewards earned is determined by the Card Account user, whether the payment is made through the PayPal account, and the amount of Eligible Purchases made on a daily basis. Cash Rewards may be reduced by any applicable Cash Rewards adjustments. Synchrony Bank (“Synchrony”) is the issuer of the Card Account, and it is only available to Accountholders who have an open PayPal account to which the Card Account is linked, and both accounts must be maintained in good standing. Your participation in the Program is subject to these Program Terms. </p>
           <br clear="all">
<p><strong>“Eligible Purchases” </strong>means the dollar amount of purchases of goods and services made using your Card Account. Eligible Purchases also means the dollar amount of transactions when you use the Card Account to send money to another PayPal user through your PayPal account. Eligible Purchases do not include balance transfers, cash advances, convenience checks, disputed transactions, unauthorized or fraudulent transactions, interest, fees, as applicable, or any other transactions that Synchrony may determine in its sole discretion are not eligible to earn Cash Rewards.</p>
            
  <p><strong>Earn Cash Rewards on Eligible Purchases.</strong></p>
        <p>At the end of each day, your Eligible Purchases will be totaled, and the amount of the Cash Rewards earned will be determined as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>3%:</strong> <strong>Each </strong>Eligible Purchase made by you through your PayPal account (online or in-store), or when you send money to other PayPal users through your PayPal account will earn 3% Cash Rewards.</li>
               <li><strong>2%:</strong> <strong>Each </strong> Eligible Purchase made by you everywhere else that Mastercard is accepted will earn 2% Cash Rewards. </li>
                <li><strong>2%:</strong> <strong>Each </strong>Eligible Purchase made by any authorized user(s) will earn 2% Cash Rewards. In the event an authorized user is, in the future, able to add their Card to their PayPal account, then Eligible Purchases made by such authorized user through their PayPal account or when they send money to other PayPal users through their PayPal account will earn 3% Cash Rewards and Eligible Purchases made everywhere else that Mastercard is accepted will continue to earn 2% Cash Rewards.</li>
  </ul>

            <p>There is no minimum amount of Eligible Purchases required before earning Cash Rewards and there is no maximum amount of Eligible Purchases that may earn Cash Rewards.</p>
<p>Cash Rewards earned do not expire although they may be forfeited in accordance with these terms. Transactions resulting in fractions of Cash Rewards will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent if equal to or greater than $0.005 and rounded down if less than $0.005.</p>
            <p>From time to time, bonus Cash Rewards (“Bonus Rewards”) may be available for certain Eligible Purchases and may include spending thresholds or limits, time period restrictions, or other factors. Bonus Rewards will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Bonus Rewards offer made to you in addition to these Program Terms.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use your Cash Rewards.</strong> Cash Rewards earned, as provided herein, will be made available for transfer via a credit to the Accountholder’s PayPal account within approximately three days after each Eligible Purchase is made. In order to transfer Cash Rewards, you must have at least $0.01 Cash Rewards available. To transfer Cash Rewards to your PayPal account, log on to your PayPal account, access your Card Account Rewards Summary Page, and transfer the amount you choose to your PayPal account. Once transferred to your PayPal account, the availability to use Cash Rewards will depend upon whether or not you have a PayPal Balance account. If you have a PayPal Balance account, Cash Rewards will then be available for use by you for making payments and purchases and sending money, subject to the terms and conditions of your PayPal Balance account. If you do not have a PayPal Balance account, your only option will be to transfer your Cash Rewards to your bank account or debit card linked to your PayPal account.</p>

            <p><strong>Cash Rewards adjustments.</strong> Adjustments will be made to your Cash Rewards as the result of canceled transactions, refunds or other credits from merchants, and other credits to your Card Account (including those resulting from successful transaction disputes). An adjustment also may occur if these Program Terms are violated by you or we believe you are abusing or gaming the Rewards Program. An adjustment may reduce Cash Rewards in an amount up to the amount of any Cash Rewards originally earned on the Eligible Purchase. Adjustments may cause a negative balance in your Cash Rewards. If there are negative Cash Rewards at the end of day, they will not be available for you to transfer to your PayPal&nbsp;account as provided herein.</p>
            <p><strong>Card Account and PayPal account statuses.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                      <li><strong>If your Card Account is delinquent:</strong> If you fail to pay your minimum payment due by the end of a billing cycle, then at the start of the next billing cycle, you may be unable to earn and/or redeem Cash Rewards until you make such payment to bring your Card Account current to cure the delinquency. If you fail to pay your minimum payment due for two consecutive billing cycles, then at the start of the third billing cycle, you will not earn any Cash Rewards and any Cash Rewards in your Card Account will be forfeited.</li>
                      <li><strong>If your Card Account is closed:</strong> Your participation in the Program will be terminated and any Cash Rewards in your Card Account will be forfeited.</li>
                      <li><strong>If your PayPal account is suspended for any reason: </strong>You will be unable to redeem your Cash Rewards until your PayPal account is reinstated. </li>
                      <li><strong>If your PayPal account is closed or if your Card Account is no longer linked to your PayPal account: </strong>Your Card Account will be closed and any Cash Rewards in your Card Account will be forfeited. </li>         
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other conditions.</strong> You acknowledge that the Program is a promotional program as to which no consideration has been paid to you and that Cash Rewards have no cash value. You may not transfer Cash Rewards in your Card Account to anyone else. Cash Rewards earned from Eligible Purchases made by authorized users on your Card Account may only be transferred to your PayPal account. Unless and until you transfer the Cash Rewards to your PayPal account and use them in accordance with your PayPal account terms, no tangible or intangible right, title, or interest in the Cash Rewards has been earned. Nothing herein requires Synchrony to credit Cash Rewards to any Card Account or to permit you to transfer any Cash Rewards to your PayPal account if the Program has been canceled, terminated or suspended. The Program, including these Program Terms, is subject to the Governing Law and Arbitration provisions of the agreement governing your Card Account. You consent and authorize Synchrony and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates or any non-affiliated third parties with whom they contract to manage the Program to share information about you and the Program with PayPal and, as necessary, to effect, administer, enforce, service, or fulfill the terms of the Program. The Program is void where prohibited by federal, state, or local law. </p>

<p><strong>Program modifications.</strong> Synchrony reserves the right to add, modify or delete any benefit, service or feature of the Program at any time in its sole discretion. Changes to the Program may include, among other things, adding a cap to the amount of purchases&nbsp;that will qualify for Cash Rewards, modifying Eligible Purchases, excluding transactions, imposing additional restrictions or terminating the Program. Synchrony reserves the right to remove any participant from the Program in the event of fraud or abuse in connection with the Program. </p>
