    "faqHeader": "Frequently asked questions",
    "faqQuestion1": "What is PayPal Credit?",
    "faqAnswer1": "PayPal Credit is a service with a credit line from Comenity Capital Bank that gives you the flexibility to pay for your purchase now, or pay over time. It’s easy to apply and easy to use.",
    "faqQuestion2": "How do I start using PayPal Credit?",
    "faqAnswer2": "Select PayPal Credit as your payment choice during checkout. You’ll be asked to provide your date of birth and the last 4 digits of your Social Security number, and then to agree to the terms and conditions. You’ll know within seconds if you are approved. And here’s the cool thing: link your PayPal Credit account to your PayPal account and you’ll see it as a payment option when you checkout with PayPal.",
    "faqAnswer2Para2": "Shopping on eBay? Look for the PayPal Credit option on the Choose Payment Method page, or when you check out with PayPal. PayPal Credit can be used for most purchases on eBay, except in the following categories: adult, digital goods, weapons, alcohol, and vehicles (PayPal Credit is available for auto parts and accessories).",
    "faqQuestion3": "How do I pay my PayPal Credit bill?",
    "faqAnswer3": "You’ll receive monthly statements and can choose to pay in full or over time (interest charges apply). For your convenience, you can keep track of your purchases and make payments on PayPal.com.",
    "faqQuestion4": "Is there an annual fee to use PayPal Credit?",
    "faqAnswer4": "Nope! There is no annual fee to use PayPal Credit.",
    "faqQuestion5": "Will I have a Credit Line and how much will it be?",
    "faqAnswer5": "Yes, you will! Once you’re approved, Comenity Capital Bank will open a PayPal Credit account with a Credit Line of at least $250.",
    "faqAnswer5Para2": "You can continue to use PayPal Credit for purchases and, if those purchases cause your outstanding balance to exceed your Credit Line, we’ll evaluate you for a Credit Line increase. This will happen automatically during checkout, so you don’t even need to ask.",
    "faqQuestion6": "What is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)?",
    "faqAnswer6": "The Annual Percentage Rate for a PayPal Credit line is 19.99%, although some special offers have a lower, promotional APR.",
    "faqQuestion7": "What does ‘Subject to Credit Approval’ mean?",
    "faqAnswer7": "Comenity Capital Bank, the lender for PayPal Credit, will review and consider your credit report and other credit related information. Once you’re approved, they’ll open your account and establish your Credit Line. This process happens in a matter of seconds as a part of the checkout process.",
    "faqQuestion8": "Do you check my credit report every time I make a purchase?",
    "faqAnswer8": "No. A credit report is reviewed when you apply for PayPal Credit and occasionally when you attempt to increase your credit line. Periodically, we’ll obtain updates of your report, but these updates have no impact on your credit score. If for any reason your Credit Line is decreased, you’ll be notified of the reason in writing.",
    "faqQuestion9": "Is there a fee for late payments?",
    "faqAnswer9": "Yes, you will be charged a late fee for each month that the minimum payment is not paid by the payment due date. The first time you’re late, the amount of the late fee will be the same amount as the missed payment, up to $25. If you’re late again, the late fee will be up to $35.",
    "faqQuestion10": "Does PayPal Credit protect me from liability for unauthorized charges?",
    "faqAnswer10": "Yes! PayPal Credit provides zero fraud liability protection, the same protection provided by most major credit cards. And we verify your identity with top-of-mind information such as your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number, so there’s no account number that can be lost or stolen.",
    "faqQuestion11": "Where else can I use PayPal Credit?",
    "faqAnswer11": "PayPal Credit is available on purchases at thousands of stores that accept PayPal. It’s also available for purchases on eBay and exclusively at thousands of other online stores."

    "isPayPalCreditSuitableQuestion": "Is PayPal Credit suitable for the type of credit you are looking for",
    "isPayPalCreditSuitableAnswer": "PayPal Credit is a revolving credit product and would be an expensive way to borrow large amounts over a long period. When making an application for a PayPal credit account, you are applying for Credit. It is important to note that you will only be offered one of these products, depending on your credit score.  It is important that you read the information provided to determine if PayPal Credit is suitable for your needs.",
    "repayUnderCreditQuestion": "How much will I have to repay under the Credit Agreement?",
    "repayUnderCreditAnswer": "The total amount you have to repay will depend on how much you spend using your PayPal Credit and how much of the outstanding balance you repay each month. You can pay off as much of the balance each month as you would like, but you must pay at least the minimum payment set out in your statement each month before the date shown there. Details of how this is calculated are set out in your pre-contract information. If you do not pay off the whole balance owed every month, you will be charged interest, which could mean it will take you longer, and cost you more, to repay the full balance.",
    "noRepaymentQuestion": "What are the consequences to me if I do not keep up with repayments?",
    "noRepaymentAnswer": "It is important that you make at least the minimum payment when it is due. Failure to make the minimum monthly payment on time will result in a late payment fee of £12. Other interest may be charged. As a consequence of this, the total cost of your debt may grow. If you don’t make your payments on time, we are entitled to record any defaults that you make at Credit Reference Agencies. This may make obtaining credit more difficult and more expensive in the future. We may also be entitled to move funds from your digital wallet with PayPal to settle any outstanding payments. It could also result in legal action being taken against you, by us, or a third party to whom we may have sold the debt, which could result in a court order being obtained and you incurring legal costs. A court order may result in any outstanding debt being secured against your home.",
    "withdrawCreditAgreementQuestion": "What rights do I have to withdraw from the Credit Agreement once I have entered it?",
    "withdrawCreditAgreementAnswer": "If you decide that you no longer want your new PayPal Credit, you have 14 days from the day after you receive confirmation of PayPal Credit to tell us you want to withdraw from the Credit Agreement. If you want to withdraw, you must tell us before the end of this time by writing to us at PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. Société en Commandite par Actions.",
